# Java Programming Solving Problems with Software

My solutions to the Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software course from Coursera. 

These programs are part of the course assignments. There are some specific libraries in use that belongs to the Duke University, those can run only on the BlueJ IDE developed by Duke, which was a requirement for the assignments grading.

Nevertheless, they can be replaced by standard Java libraries in case you want to try the code outside of the BlueJ environment.
